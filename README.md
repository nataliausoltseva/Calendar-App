# Calendar-App

This wed-app is based on the [Calendar-API] (https://github.com/nataliausoltseva/Calendar-API).

### How to use it:
If a user wants to create an event then they have to provide:
- Event
- Location
- Start time
- End Time

### How to run project:
1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate to the `my-app` directory
3. Install the packages by running `npm install`
4. Once the node_modules folder has been created and all the dependences have been successfully installed, `npm run start` to compile the project and run locally on `localhost:3000`

***Note***: The project has a live reloader when you save any changes in the project. Hence you will NOT need to call `npm run start` every time.
